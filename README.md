# Spam and Ham Detection

This project is a simple yet effective implementation of spam and ham (non-spam) email detection using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. It preprocesses the text data using various techniques such as lowercasing, tokenization, removing special characters, stop words, punctuation, and stemming to enhance the efficiency of the classifier.

## Features

- **Data cleaning and preprocessing:** The project performs the following steps for data preprocessing:
  1. Convert text to lowercase.
  2. Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words or tokens.
  3. Removing special characters: Eliminating non-alphanumeric characters from the text.
  4. Removing stop words and punctuation: Filtering out common stop words and punctuation marks.
  5. Stemming: Reducing words to their root or base form to normalize the text.

- **Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier:** The project utilizes the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm for machine learning, which is particularly suitable for text classification tasks.

- **Streamlit Web App:** A Streamlit web application is included in the project for easy interaction and demonstration of the spam and ham detection functionality.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset containing labeled emails, with each email classified as either spam or ham.
